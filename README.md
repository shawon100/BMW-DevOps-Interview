# Coding challenge 🏅

Dear candidate,

welcome to our coding challenge. We are glad you made it so far and we're looking forward to seeing your results.

This challenge can't be won like a car race. It's a chance to show your skills and working practice.
We like to see how you tackle the challenge. There is no right solution. 

## Time limit 🕑

As in real life there are some constraints. On one hand this saves you from wasting your time hunting for perfection, 
on the other hand we will get an idea what you focus on.

We expect you to return your solution within **2 hours**.

## The challenge 🏆

We'd like you to face a task you might encounter in your daily work in one of our teams.
Next to this README you'll find a small `yaml` file. 
It represents a `project`, which consist of a list of `teams` and their `members` and `roles`.

Please write a **command line tool** using **Python** which parses the yaml file and performs some basic validations.

### Featured validations ✅

- Ensure all mails end with `bmw.de`
- Ensure there is no empty team in the yaml file

### Areas to cover 🤹

We'd like to see some of the following areas addressed in your solution:

- Documentation
- Error handling
- Unit tests
- Some "basic" code quality assurance
- Packaging for shipment to customer

With respect to the limited time we do not expect you to cover each topic in perfection, 
but we are interested in what you consider "basic". Please try to cover all areas and write down TODOs for open tasks. 

### Areas not to cover ❎

With respect to time and missing infrastructure we skip CI/CD for this challenge, 
although we consider it mandatory for professional software development.

## Review 🔍

A peer review, which we also consider required during development, will be part of our online interview. 
There we would like to discuss your solution and the decisions you made.

## Submission 📦

Please just zip your results and return them per mail.


HAPPY CODING 💻 🚀
